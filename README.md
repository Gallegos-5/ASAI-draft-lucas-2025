# Scientific Innovation Acceleration & Scaling Act (ASAI)

**A blueprint for open, AI-accelerated, adversarially reviewed U.S. science and technology innovation.**

---
> **Why it matters:**  
> • **Any U.S. person can propose breakthrough projects—no gatekeepers**  
> • **Milestone funding + blue/red-team review stops waste, bias, and stagnation**  
> • **AI co-governance ensures speed, scale, and transparency**  
> • **Every decision, dissent, and audit is hash-chained and public**  
> • **First national “moonshot engine” open to all innovators—scientists, founders, students, and the public**

## Overview

The **Scientific Innovation Acceleration & Scaling Act (ASAI)** establishes a new, national agency to surface, pilot, and scale U.S. scientific breakthroughs. Any eligible person can submit. AI assists triage, blue/red teams vet ideas, and funding moves at the speed of discovery—all with radical transparency and public audit.

---

## What Does ASAI Do?

- **Open, always-on submission:**  
  Anyone can propose, from Nobel laureates to students—no insider-only process.
- **AI-powered triage & transparency:**  
  All proposals are scored, clustered, and surfaced by explainable AI with a full public trail.
- **Milestone-driven, adversarial review:**  
  Projects get milestone funding and must clear both blue (optimize) and red (stress test) teams.
- **Public audit & appeal:**  
  Every decision, dissent, and outcome is hash-chained and open for challenge or review.
- **Open science repository:**  
  All results, code, and data are published in a national open repository (with security/export carve-outs).
- **Regional equity:**  
  Consulates, academy, and partner nodes ensure reach to every state, territory, and background.
